My first programming project!

Created early June 2014 as a final project for my junior year of high school, I created this entire game by scratch. The only thing that doesn't belong to me is the music, which was created open source by RoccoW (roccowchiptune@gmail.com), and a few support classes for audio and timing. Here is nearly the exact same copy of what I did three years ago, with an added easter egg.

The reason I'm uploading this now is just to see how far I've come. Perhaps in the future, I'll remake this project. I hope you like it!
